Introduction:

The project that I will be attempting this semester is a competition project from Kaggle.com. This projects goal is to rank the 'adoptability' of animals in shelters through different variables and statistical methods, along with some machine learning tactics for similar animals. I will be able to pull files of collected information for statistical analysis from the Kaggle competition website. https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction

// Laura Tesoriero // EE 551 - Project Proposal

Project Pivot:

Originally, the project that I was going to attempt was a kaggle competition project, that ranked the adoptibility of animals. However, 
due to my small background in python and limited knowledge of machine learning I am pivoting my project to be based on object oriented 
programming, along with some data structures application. 

New Project:

My new project will be a money management application. This application will keep track of expenses, income, investments, and loans. I 
will also be implementting a database platform for the project, utilizing SQL. This application will also send reminders to pay bills on 
time, when implemented into the calendar portion.
